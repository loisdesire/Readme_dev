// // This is a basic Flutter widget test.
// //
// // To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// // utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// // gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// // tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

// This file used to contain the default Flutter counter test. It has been
// commented out but must still define a `main` so the test runner can load
// the file without error. The meaningful widget tests live in other files.

void main() {}
