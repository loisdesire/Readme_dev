## Firestore rules rewrite (2026-09-12)

`firestore.rules` previously read:

```
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

Any signed-in user — including a child account — could read or write *any*
document in the database: other children's personality/reading data, the
`admins` collection, `books`, `admin_settings`. The in-app admin check
(`admin_portal_screen.dart`'s `_isAdmin` bool) was cosmetic; nothing enforced
it server-side.

The rules now grant access per-collection, based on how the app actually
uses each one (see the comments at the top of `firestore.rules`):

- `books`, `book_quizzes`, `quiz_questions`, `achievements` stay readable by
  **any signed-in user** — tightening this by accident is what broke the
  library once before, so it's called out explicitly in the rules file and
  covered by a test.
- Per-child activity (`reading_progress`, `reading_sessions`, `quiz_results`,
  etc.) is readable/writable by its owner, readable by a linked parent
  (`users/{child}.parentIds` contains the parent's uid), and readable/writable
  by admins.
- `role: 'admin'` on a user's own doc can no longer be self-granted.
- The PIN/QR parent-linking flow (`add_child_screen.dart`,
  `qr_scanner_widget.dart`) still works for a *not-yet-linked* parent — the
  rule allows adding your own uid to a child's `parentIds` and nothing else.

### Before you deploy this

**Do not just push this to production.** Run the test suite first, and after
deploying, smoke-test the real app against it in a dev/staging build (log in
as a child and confirm the library loads, as a parent confirm linking and the
dashboard work, as an admin confirm the upload panel works) before trusting
it with real users.

```bash
cd firestore-tests
npm install
npm test        # spins up the Firestore emulator, runs 26 rule tests, tears down
```

Deploy once tests pass and you've reviewed the diff:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Bootstrapping the first admin

Because the open write-anywhere hole is closed, a user can no longer make
themselves admin from the app. Use the Admin SDK instead:

```bash
node tools/set_admin.js you@example.com
```

Requires `tools/serviceAccountKey.json` (gitignored — generate a **new** one
from Firebase Console → Project settings → Service accounts; see below for
why "new").

## Exposed service account key — rotate it

Commit `5bfd28e` ("upload books") added `tools/serviceAccountKey.json` to
this repo. A later commit updated `.gitignore` to stop it from being
re-added, but the key file itself is still present in git history (project
`readme-40267` — check whether that project is still active; if it is,
treat this as urgent).

**Action needed (not done by this change):** in Google Cloud / Firebase
Console, revoke that specific service account key and generate a new one for
local tooling. Moving branches or repos does not undo the exposure — the key
has to be rotated at the source regardless of where the code lives.

## Known gaps not addressed by this change

- Automated tests now cover: the Firestore rules (`firestore-tests/`, 26
  cases); the app's core scoring logic (`test/services/personality_scoring_test.dart`,
  `achievement_rules_test.dart`, pulled into pure functions specifically so
  they could be tested); `AuthProvider` end-to-end (`test/providers/`,
  9 cases — signUp/signIn, Firebase-error-to-friendly-message mapping,
  quiz-result persistence, parent/child linking, the account-removed
  auto-signout path); and `AchievementService.checkAndUnlockAchievements`
  end-to-end (4 cases — unlock writes, points awarded, notification sent,
  no double-awarding). `FirebaseService`, `NotificationService`,
  `WeeklyChallengeService`, and `FirestoreHelpers` all gained a
  `.withInstances(...)` constructor for this (see each file) — production
  behavior is unchanged, since the default constructor still uses the real
  Firebase singletons.
  Still not covered: `BookProvider` and `UserProvider` (same injectable
  pattern would apply — `BookProvider` in particular is large and is
  where the recommendation-matching logic lives) and the AI/Cloud
  Functions side (`functions/index.js`, Node — a different test setup
  entirely, e.g. the Functions emulator or a mocked OpenAI client). The
  Chapter 4 thesis test tables (unit/integration/functional, all "Pass")
  still describe manual testing from before this change, not this
  regression suite.
- Recommendation/business logic runs client-side in Dart rather than in a
  trusted backend — Cloud Functions bypass Firestore rules entirely via the
  Admin SDK, but the Flutter client's own scoring/matching logic is still
  visible to and tamperable by a sufficiently motivated user.
- The in-app privacy policy claims "COPPA Compliant" — that claim should be
  re-reviewed (parental consent flow, data minimization, deletion handling)
  now that the data-access story has actually changed, not left as boilerplate.
